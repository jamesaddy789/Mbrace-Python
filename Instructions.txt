Use Python 3 and up for these scripts.

If python isn't already installed on the machine, 
install the recent version for the machine's operating system at:
python.org/downloads

Pip should install with the current version of python 
but if for some reason pip isn't installed yet, 
follow the instructions at:
Pypi.org/project/pip

In Windows, MacOS, and Linux command shell install necessary libraries using:
python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib

Or if multiple versions of python are installed:
python3 -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib

If a Python Version lower than 3 is used, 
scripts will need to be run using:
python3 nameOfScript.py

Otherwise, the script can be run with the command:
python nameOfScript.py

Script descriptions:
[Executable Scripts]
-MbraceFTP.py will list experiment files from Mbrace.xyz's file server 
and allow the user to download the file to the current folder.

-MbracePlot.py will plot the selected file from the directory selected. 
This script needs Mbrace.py to be in the same folder.
Since this script requires data files to use, 
it should be used after files have been downloaded
such as after using MbraceFTP.py. 

-MbraceCompositeData.py has two main functions. 
One function will collect all experiment data from the server 
and download it into a folder named "Mbrace Composite Data" 
and organize the data into folders based on the MAC address in the file names. 
The second function will composite the files of each MAC address based on the date range the files belong to.

[Modules]
-Mbrace.py is a module containing a class named Mbrace_Data that is used to interpret the data in an experiment's binary file 
and convert it into Numpy arrays. 
The arrays are properties that can be accessed once an Mbrace instance (class object) is created. 
This script is a module to be used by other scripts 
and not to be run like an executable script.
